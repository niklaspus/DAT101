      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[when the wake up time is not 7, for example when its 6 it wont execute anything, since there is no else line yet.
        when its exactly 7, it executes and prints out the first if line]</p>
      
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[if the wake up time is not 7, it runs the else statement line. the program first checks whether the if statement is true based on the value given, and if it is it runs the if statement.
        so when its exactly 7, it runs the if line. which in this case is "i can take the bus to school" ]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[when the wake time is less than 7, it prints out that he can take the bus, since i use the less than or equal function, since its logical in this context.
        if he wakes up before 7 he can still make the bus. if its greater than 8, it executes the else line since its not less or equal to the previous statements. ]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[It prints out that 0 is positive, but its because my code checks if the number is less than 0 and therefore 0 prints out positive, but negative, zero and positive
        are three different integers, and therefore i have to create a else if that checks if it is 0 and prints out zero. Zero is neutral]</p>
