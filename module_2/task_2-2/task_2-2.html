      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[You should use constants where values should stay the same when executing, and let if want to allow the value to change. they could all be constants,
         but this makes values unable to change]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[parentheses affects the order of what is performing first. Operations inside parentheses are executed first.
         And you can use parentheses to unify code inside.  ]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[you can use toFixed() This rounds up to the decimal you choose to type inside the parentheses ]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[first you have to check if the numbers are close enough within a certain range that is tolerable. if the statement of the range is true,
        you can compare the two numbers and get a true statement that they are equal ]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[comparison operators return a boolean value based on if the conditions are true or false.
        You can check if they are false or true by printing the result]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() generates a random floating point number, and can for example be used for a coin toss program to randomize the result]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[modulus is a operator which calculates whats left of several numbers. We need this to solve percentage calculations, for example if there is several
        values we need to manage like weeks and days ]
